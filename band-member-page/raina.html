              <h4>
               Hey, my names Raina and I’m the lead singer, song writer and hair color of the band. I’ve been into music since birth and have been in countless ensembles from choir to Percussion from k-12th. My roots are very mixed, but the main cultural influence for my music career has been from my Filipino family and the Dirksen clan. I have experience from singing in woman’s ensembles in and out of school to gospel, drum circles and impromptu band meet ups and karaoke. I love making music up on the spot, and sharing different cultures and emotions with the audience through me and my bands songs. I’m an artist who dabbles in every craft from selling antiques, make Worbla armor, painting, tattoo commissions, make silver rings and content creation. To summarize, there isn’t a subject I haven’t explored in and out of the art and science world.
