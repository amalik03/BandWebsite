              <h4>
                Hey, my names Raina and I’m the lead singer, song writer and hair
                color of the band. I’ve been into music since birth and have been in
                countless ensembles from choir to Percussion from k-12th. My roots
                are very mixed, but the main cultural influence for my music career
                has been from my Filipino family and the Dirksen clan. I have
                experience from singing in woman’s ensembles in and out of school to
                gospel, drum circles and impromptu band meet ups and karaoke. I love
                making music up on the spot, and sharing different cultures and
                emotions with the audience through me and my bands songs. I’m an
                artist who dabbles in every craft from selling antiques, make Worbla
                armor, painting, tattoo commissions, make silver rings and content
                creation. To summarize, there isn’t a subject I haven’t explored in
                and out of the art and science world.
